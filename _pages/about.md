# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am Jessica. I hold a PhD in computational physics and work as a Data Scientist. Originally, I am from Germany, but after having spent some time living in Mexico, Spain and Scotland, I now live in London, UK (at least for the moment).

I sneeze a lot and love horrible jokes. Here is one of my favourite coding related ones: "! False" (it's funny because it's true).

## ðŸ“« Where to find me
On the internet, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-walkenhorst/) or here. IRL, you can find me co-organizing [London's PyData Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-london-meetup/), data-diving for [DataKindUK](https://datakind.org.uk/) or practicing my Judo moves. So if you meet me at any of these events, come and say hi. Extra credit if you bring a joke! ðŸ˜„

## &#x270d; Blog & Writing
In my spare time I like to learn new technologies and play around with data. Every so often I will blog about my experience doing so - You can find my articles here as well as on [Medium](https://medium.com/@walkenho).
